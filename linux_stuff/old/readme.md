## spotify-np
This script grabs now playing information *(song title, who made it, the album art, and a scannable tag)* from Spotify's default client using `playerctl` for use in OBS sources. By default, files will be placed in `/tmp/now_playing`.

***I've stopped using this script in favor of something a bit more advanced. See the `spotify-overlay` folder***
